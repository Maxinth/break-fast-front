        In the scenario whereby any purchase activity looks suspicious, We may delay the payment of Affiliate 
                commissions by about 3 calendar months to verify the genuineness of the sales.
                Kreatesell reserves the right to recalculate, make void, or disqualify any Affiliate
                commissions in the event of any fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise illegal activity.

        Should in any case a customer purchases anything on Kreatesell through Kreatesell promotional or special offers-
                be it Kreatesell’s premium plans or Kreators’ product after the expiration period of an affiliate 
                cookie who promotes to such customer, the affiliate promoter will not be qualified 
                to receive commission for such purchases.
